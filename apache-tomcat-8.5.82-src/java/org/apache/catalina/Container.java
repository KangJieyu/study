/**
 * A <b>Container</b> is an object that can execute requests received from
 * a client, and return responses based on those requests.  A Container may
 * optionally support a pipeline of Valves that process the request in an
 * order configured at runtime, by implementing the <b>Pipeline</b> interface
 * as well.
 *
 * Container 是一个对象，他能够执行从客户端接收的请求，且基于这些请求返回响应。
 * 通过实现 Pipeline 接口，一个 Container 可能选择支持一个阀门管道，这些管道按照运行时
 * 的配置顺序处理请求。
 *
 * <p>
 * Containers will exist at several conceptual levels within Catalina.  The
 * following examples represent common cases:
 * Containers 在 Catalina 中存在几个概念上的级别。以下是一些常见的例子：(Engine Host Context Wrapper 是一个 Container)
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Engine</b> - Representation of the entire Catalina servlet engine,
 *     most likely containing one or more subcontainers that are either Host
 *     or Context implementations, or other custom groups.
 *     Engine - 表示整个的 Catalina servlet 引擎，可能包含一个或多个子容器，他们是 Host
 *     或 Context 实现，或其他自定义组。
 * <li><b>Host</b> - Representation of a virtual host containing a number
 *     of Contexts.
 *     Host - 表示一个虚拟的包含多个 Context 的主机。
 * <li><b>Context</b> - Representation of a single ServletContext, which will
 *     typically contain one or more Wrappers for the supported servlets.
 *     Context - 表示一个单独的 ServletContext，包含一个或多个支持 servlet 的 Wrapper。
 * <li><b>Wrapper</b> - Representation of an individual servlet definition
 *     (which may support multiple servlet instances if the servlet itself
 *     implements SingleThreadModel).
 *     Wrapper - 表示单独的 servlet 定义(如果 servlet 自己实现了 SingleTreadModel
 *     可能支持多个 servlet 实例)。
 * </ul>
 * A given deployment of Catalina need not include Containers at all of the
 * levels described above.  For example, an administration application
 * embedded within a network device (such as a router) might only contain
 * a single Context and a few Wrappers, or even a single Wrapper if the
 * application is relatively small.  Therefore, Container implementations
 * need to be designed so that they will operate correctly in the absence
 * of parent Containers in a given deployment.
 * Catalina 的部署不需要包括上面描述的所有 Containers。如，嵌入一个网络设备(如路由器)中的
 * 管理的应用程序可能包含一个 Context 和多个 Wrapper，如果应用程序是相对小的甚至是一个 Wrapper。
 * 因此，Container 的实现需要被设计，以至于在没有父 Container 的情况下他们也可正确的运行。
 * <p>
 * A Container may also be associated with a number of support components
 * that provide functionality which might be shared (by attaching it to a
 * parent Container) or individually customized.  The following support
 * components are currently recognized:
 * 一个 Container 还可能和许多支持组件相关联，这些组件可以共享通过其附加到父 container 或者
 * 单独定义的功能。目前识别的组件包括：
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Loader</b> - Class loader to use for integrating new Java classes
 *     for this Container into the JVM in which Catalina is running.
 *     Loader - 将这个 Container 中新的 Java 类集成到正在运行的 Catalina 中的 JVM
 *     的类加载器。
 * <li><b>Logger</b> - Implementation of the <code>log()</code> method
 *     signatures of the <code>ServletContext</code> interface.
 *     Logger - ServletContext 接口中 log() 方法的实现。
 * <li><b>Manager</b> - Manager for the pool of Sessions associated with
 *     this Container.
 *     Manager - 和这个 Container 相关联的 Session 池的管理器。
 * <li><b>Realm</b> - Read-only interface to a security domain, for
 *     authenticating user identities and their corresponding roles.
 *     Realm - 安全域中仅读的接口，用于认证用户的身份和他们相应的角色。
 * <li><b>Resources</b> - JNDI directory context enabling access to static
 *     resources, enabling custom linkages to existing server components when
 *     Catalina is embedded in a larger server.
 *     Resources - JNDI目录上下文能够访问静态资源，当 Catalina 在大型服务器中时支持
 *     对存在的服务器组件进行自定义链接。
 * </ul>
